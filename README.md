# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms in Python. These algorithms cover a range of models, from classical methods to more advanced approaches. The goal is to provide an educational and practical resource for those interested in learning and applying Machine Learning techniques.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

1. **Naive Bayes:** Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier for classification problems.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN algorithm for both classification and regression.

3. **Gradient Boosting:** Implementation of boosting algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting, to enhance model accuracy.

4. **Clustering:** Implementation of clustering algorithms, including K-Means, to identify patterns and structures in datasets.

5. **Neural Networks:** Basic implementations of neural networks using popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

6. **Neural Networks:** Others
